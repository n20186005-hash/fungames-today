# 🔪 Knife Hit Master

Welcome to this addictive arcade challenge that tests your reflexes and precision! Do you have the sharp eyes and quick hands to become the ultimate knife-throwing master?

## 🎮 How to Play

The rules are simple, but mastering them is the real challenge:

* **Tap to Throw**: Click the screen or your mouse to launch a knife.
* **Break the Log**: Embed all your knives into the rotating log to shatter it and advance to the next stage.
* **The Golden Rule**: **Watch out!** Never hit a knife that is already stuck in the log. One mistake, and it's Game Over immediately.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Unpredictable Spinning Logs
Don't expect the log to spin at a constant speed! As you progress, the rotation patterns become trickier:
* **Variable Speed**: The log may suddenly speed up or slow down.
* **Tricky Movement**: It might even stop completely or reverse direction, testing your anticipation skills.

### 2. Slice Apples for Bonus Points 🍎
Keep an eye out for **red apples** attached to the logs. Accurate shots that slice through them will earn you extra bonus points and show off your precision.

### 3. Satisfying Impact
* **Immersive Audio**: Enjoy realistic sound effects—from the thud of the knife hitting wood to the sharp clang of metal-on-metal collisions.
* **Visual Feedback**: Feel the impact with flying wood chips and subtle screen shakes with every successful hit.

### 4. Global Support 🌍
The game features built-in multi-language support, allowing players to enjoy the experience in **English**, Chinese, Japanese, and more.
