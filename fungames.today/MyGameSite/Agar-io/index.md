# Agar.io Cell Survival

# Description
This is a classic and highly optimized multiplayer online arena (IO) game. In this microscopic world, the only rule of survival is "eat or be eaten." Players control a cell and must grow larger by devouring colorful particles on the map and smaller cells, while constantly watching out for giant predators. Featuring a smooth physics engine and smart AI opponents, it offers a stress-relieving yet thrilling competitive experience anytime, anywhere.

# Key Features
* **Dual Game Modes**:
    * **Standard Mode (FFA)**: The classic battle royale experience. Survive among giants and fight your way to the top of the leaderboard.
    * **Infinite Mode (∞)**: The ultimate relaxation choice! Activate "God Mode" where you bounce off walls, cannot be eaten by bots, and enjoy pure growth without the stress of dying.
* **Auto-Save System**: Never worry about closing the tab or refreshing. The game automatically saves your current score, mass, and location so you can resume your conquest at any time.
* **Game Speed Control**: A unique time-control feature that allows players to adjust the game speed freely between **0.5x** (Slow Motion) and **2.0x** (Fast Paced) to match their preferred rhythm.
* **Multi-Language Support**: Built-in support for 6 languages: English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Russian.

# Gameplay
1.  **Grow**: Move around the map and eat randomly generated colorful "food" to increase your initial size.
2.  **Hunt**: Once you are larger than other cells, chase and engulf them to gain massive amounts of mass.
3.  **Split**: Use the "Split" ability to divide yourself in two, launching half your body forward to catch fleeing prey instantly.
4.  **Avoid**: Stay away from cells bigger than you. Also, beware of green spiky "Viruses"—touching them while big will cause you to explode into tiny pieces.
