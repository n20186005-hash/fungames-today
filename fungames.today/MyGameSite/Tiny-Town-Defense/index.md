## 💡 Gameplay Tips

1.  **Watch Your HP**: If the town's Health Points (HP) drop to zero, it's Game Over. Prioritize killing enemies that are close to the ground.
2.  **Manage Your Gold**: Don't spend all your gold at once. Decide wisely between building Turrets for damage or Walls for defense based on the situation.
3.  **Grab Power-ups**: Never ignore the blue "Rapid Fire" icon—it significantly boosts your firepower for a short time!
4.  **Watch the Skies**: Enemies drop from above. Predict their landing spots and position yourself early to intercept them.
