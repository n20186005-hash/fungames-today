# Game Introduction: Paper.io 360 - Deluxe Edition

## Game Name
Paper.io 360 - Deluxe Edition

## Description
This is a color war of speed, strategy, and guts! In this minimalist arena, you play as a moving block, drawing lines to claim and expand your territory. Your goal is simple: conquer as much of the map as possible, defeat competitors, and dominate the leaderboard. But beware—when you leave your territory, the trail you leave behind is your fatal weak spot. If an opponent cuts through it, it's game over!

## Key Features
* **Dual Mode Experience**:
    * **Classic Mode**: Experience the authentic tension of the arena. Hitting walls or having your trail cut results in instant death. A true test of skill and reaction.
    * **Immortal Mode (Infinite Mode)**: Designed for stress relief and relaxation. You bounce off walls instead of crashing, and attacks only clear your trail without killing you. Enjoy the pure satisfaction of painting the map.
* **Smart Auto-Save**: Features a built-in auto-save function. You can resume your progress anytime by clicking "Continue," so you never have to worry about accidentally closing the tab.
* **Immersive Experience**: Equipped with vivid sound effects (capture, kill, defeat) and supports one-click muting.
* **Multi-Language Support**: Built-in English and Chinese interfaces, switchable at any time.
* **Real-Time Data**: Features a mini-map for navigation, a real-time territory percentage bar, and a dynamic leaderboard to track the battle status instantly.

## Why Play?
If you enjoy the thrill of high-stakes gameplay or simply find satisfaction in filling a screen with color, this game is for you. With optimized controls and the thoughtful addition of "Immortal Mode," it caters to both hardcore players seeking a challenge and casual players looking to relax. No download or installation is required—just click and play. It is the perfect tool for killing time.

## Core Gameplay
1.  **Conquer & Expand**: Steer your character out of your safe zone to draw closed shapes on neutral or enemy territory. Return to your base to turn the enclosed area into your color.
2.  **Eliminate Opponents**: When enemies are moving outside their territory, dash through their trail to eliminate them and wipe their territory from the map.
3.  **Defend**: Guard your own trail carefully. Do not let enemies cut it, and avoid hitting the map edges (in Classic Mode).
4.  **Dominate**: Continuously swallow neutral areas and enemy lands to aim for 100% map domination!
