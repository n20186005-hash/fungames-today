# Gulper.io - Neon Snake Battle

## 🌌 Game Overview
Welcome to **Gulper.io**, an immersive cyberpunk-style multiplayer arcade game. In this dark digital world pulsating with neon lights, you control a glowing energy snake. Your goal is simple: slither through the void, consume energy dots to grow, and outmaneuver opponents to dominate the leaderboard.

Whether you are a competitive player seeking high-speed action or a casual player looking to relax, the dual game modes offer something for everyone.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Stunning Neon Visuals**: Features high-contrast fluorescent colors and dynamic lighting effects, creating a cool sci-fi atmosphere.
* **Dual Game Modes**:
    * **Standard Mode**: The classic survival challenge. Hitting walls or other snakes results in immediate game over.
    * **Infinite Mode**: An "immortal" experience. You bounce off walls and other snakes instead of dying, perfect for practicing skills or relaxing.
* **Smart Save System**: The game features an auto-save function. If you accidentally close the tab or refresh, you can click "Resume" to restore your length and score.
* **Global Support**: Built-in support for multiple languages including English, Chinese, Japanese, and Spanish.
* **Immersive Audio**: Equipped with dynamic Synth sound effects that provide satisfying feedback when boosting or scoring.

## 🎮 Gameplay Mechanics
1.  **Eat & Grow**: Guide your snake to consume colorful light dots or cyan crystals scattered across the map to increase your length.
2.  **Defeat Opponents**: If another snake's head crashes into your body, they are destroyed and turn into a pile of high-value energy. Use your speed to cut them off!
3.  **Boost Strategy**: You can sprint to move faster, but be careful—boosting continuously burns your own body length.
4.  **Leaderboard**: Survive longer and grow bigger to see your name climb the real-time rankings.
